            <h2>The Hidden Place</h2>
            <p>
               Boa Bookstore is a bibliophile’s hidden treasure trove, 
               with the hidden part being almost literal. 
               The address is number 6 Turtle Roundabout 
               (Room C26, 2nd Floor, 42 Tran Cao Van or 6 Cong Truong Quoc Te, D3), 
               though to reach the bookstore proper, you have to climb up two flights of stairs 
               and navigate a short stretch of sooty hallways in an old apartment building. 
               The room is number C26. The door is closed most of the time. Do not feel shy. 
               Push that closed door open and inside you will find an apartment room 
               stocked from floor to ceiling with books, books, and even more books.

            <h2>The Shelves</h2>
            <p>
               The stock here consists mostly of English- language books with a smattering of French ones. 
               Half are brand new while the other half are secondhand - all imported from the US. 
               Titles run the gamut from young adult, romance, popular self-helps 
               to finds few would expect from a Vietnamese bookstore 
               such as Dante’s Divine Comedy, HG Wells’ Seven Novel collection, 
               HP Lovecraft’s Complete Cthulhu Mythos, and even a complete collection of 
               Edgar Allan Poe’s poems and tales in three different editions: 
               hardback, hardback with illustrations, and Barnes & Noble Classic leather bound with silver or gold plated pages.

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
               Looking at the rare editions and collectible titles it boasts, 
               it’s hard to believe Boa started out two years ago as an online forum to sell secondhand books. 
               “Thuy and I started out on this tiny forum for English-language book lovers. 
               We were just regular members and were just having fun sharing our obsession with like-minded people,” 
               says Thao. “By chance, Thuy had a relative in America who occasionally shipped her a book or two. 
               She shared them online and before she knew it, people were asking her to order books for them and 
               were willing to pay a little extra for her time. That was how BOA actually started out.”

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
               Thao, 24, and Thuy, 25, opened the bookstore using their savings. 
               “A lot of people questioned our choice in business investment, our families included,” 
               shares the latter, who works a second job in a furniture company to finance their new venture. 
               “This is, after all, the era of Kindle and digital texts so it probably seems 
               a little unwise to put all your savings into a tiny book business dealing exclusively 
               with physical foreign language books. But we just love books too much to do anything else.”
               For the first year, Boa was less a book business proper and more a nameless book ordering service 
               favored by English literature students and teenagers. “We were students and broke. 
               We could afford only 10 books per month and keep maybe 20 to 30 in stock at a time. That's how small we were.”

            <h2>Stranger than Fiction</h2>
            <p>
               It took two years for Boa to get its proper name, 
               storefront and become a bookstore. That they could grow from 10 books 
               per month to an inventory of 10,000 titles in stock and 
               a monthly addition of 500 new books is a testament to the growing community 
               of English readers in Saigon.
               “We owe this to the community’s support,” say the young owners. 
               “Without their love and help, we wouldn’t be here today, 
               doing what we love and making a career out of it.” 
               To show appreciation to the community and to promote reading, 
               in the first few months of the store’s opening at the Turtle Roundabout, 
               Boa ran a public reading project named Book Station.
               “We got the idea from mini public libraries in other countries. 
               We made this little redwood box by hand, stocked it full with English books 
               and every day put it in the front yard of the restaurant downstairs. 
               Anybody walking around the Turtle Roundabout could see it,” Thao explains. 
               “The rule is that everyone is welcomed to borrow the books inside 
               provided that they bring one of theirs to replace the book they borrow. 
               The book can be new or old and about anything, provided it is in decent condition.”
